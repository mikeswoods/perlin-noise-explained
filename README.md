Perlin noise (explained)
========================

Rationale
---------
This annotated implementation of Ken Perlin's k-dimensional noise
is meant to serve as an easy-to-understand companion guide to a more in-depth
treatment of the algorithm. I wrote this code and the accompanying comments
mostly for myself in order to better understand how a gradient noise algorithm
like Perlin noise works. What better way to attempt to understand a topic
than to implement it and explain it?

Requirements
------------
Only two packages are required `numpy` and `Pillow`. They can be installed via

```
make install
```

`imagemagick` was also used to create the animations.

Examples
--------
Examples can be generated by running

```
make examples
```
